# Tic Tac Toe in HTML, Javascript and CSS

GA Challenged us to build a tic tac toe game in HTML and JavaScript.

This Tic tac toe game allows zero, one or two players. Basic and hard AI can take the remainings spots! Hard AI uses the Minimax algorithm and will calculate all possible outcomes of any next move (it can take a little longer for it to compute its first move as it calculates all possible 255168 outcomes)
